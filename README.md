# Introduction
The new age of technology allows for people worldwide to connect and share their favorite recipes. What's interesting about this is the fact that something as personal as favorite recipes now becomes something anyone can share their opinion on and try for themselves. In order to make information easier to transmit, many sites have begun using a structured system to share recipes, including trackers for how many ingredients are used, how long the recipe takes, and tags to find similar recipes. Additionally, users can leave comments and ratings on any recipe available to them. This data analysis project aims to utilize the structure of these sites to determine the relationship between user-given ratings and number of steps in a recipe.

The data utilized is sourced from food.com and contains recipes from 2008 to 2018. Initially, two datasets were used; the first containing recipe information (cook time, ingredients, tags, recipe id, publishing date, nutritional info) and the second containing user interaction information (user id, review text, and review score out of 5). The recipe dataset has 83782 unique rows, each representing a recipe. The user interaction dataset has 731927 unique rows, each representing an interaction a user had with a recipe's review section.

After data cleaning and missingness determination, this data analysis aims to prove that the more steps a recipe has, the lower the rating will be. This hypothesis will be used because it personally relates to how I utilize recipes. As a busy college student, I seek comfort food that takes minimal effort to prepare but still satisfies.
# Data Cleaning
After initializing the necessary files and reading them in as DataFrames, the first step was to merge the files together and clean up any detrimental missing values, primarily in the 'rating' column. After that, the ratings and recipes were merged to make the final DataFrame that would be used in the rest of the analysis. Additionally, the average rating per recipe was calculated and added as an additional column titled 'avg_rating'. Because of the method used to calculate and add the new column, 'rating' was renamed to 'user_rating'. Another column was expanded from a list of values, this being the nutrition column, into a column for each value ('calories(#)','total fat (PDV)', 'sugar (PDV)', 'sodium (PDV)','protein (PDV)','saturated fat (PDV)','carbohydrates (PDV)'). The final DataFrame after the above cleaning will be used for the rest of the analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Before any testing can be done to determine the answer to the question posed, it's important to understand what the variables are and what they represent. 
<iframe src="assets/avg_rating_fig.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The distribution of user given ratings.
<iframe src="assets/steps_fig.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The distribution of number of steps in a recipe.

The relationship between variables is also important to understand, especially in the context of the question at hand.
<iframe src="assets/fig.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
This scatter plot represent the relationship between number of steps and average ratings. Ratings tend to spike over each whole number, implying that people tend to agree on the quality of a recipe. If there were disagreements, people would give a variety of ratings, leading to the average rating falling between whole numbers. There is a trendline also present but it has a nearly constant slope, implying that there may be no relationship between user ratings and number of steps, but this will be determined later through testing.

While the graphs provided an interesting look at what values are recorded, the following table provides a bird's eye view of the change in data over time (using the information from the 'year_submitted' column) to observe how different nutrition values of popular recipes have changed over time.

From this table, we can see that most areas of nutrition have increased in value since 2008.

# Missingness Assessment
As previously stated, the final DataFrame contains some missing values. 'user_rating' and 'review' both contain numerous missing values. Based on the information available, I assume 'review' to be NMAR. After looking at the website the data is from, it is possible to leave a rating on the numeric scale without leaving a text review (as well as vice versa). When the data was intially collected, any user interaction that was just a numeric rating, the empty reviews were represented by '-------'.

There is a possibility that missingness of 'user_rating' is dependent on another column. With so much information available, I did several comparisons to see if the missing and non-missing ratings came from the same distribution. The null hypothesis for this question is the missingness of 'user_rating' is dependent on the 'sodium (PDV)' column.
<iframe src="assets/salt_fig.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
After running permutation tests with shuffled values for 'sodium (PDV)', the p-value of this test was so small Python rounded it to 0.0, which falls below my level of significance (0.05). This means I will fail to reject my null hypothesis, meaning the missingness of "user_rating" is missing completely at random.

# Hypothesis Testing
As stated at the beginning of this analysis, I believe user_ratings will, on average, decrease as the number of steps per recipe increase. Alternatively, 'user_rating' and 'n_steps' could have a positive relationship, 'user_rating' increasing as 'n_steps' increases.

Since both 'user_rating' and 'n_steps' are numeric varaiables, I will use the KS statistic as my test value and compare the final values to generate my p-value. For this portion of testing, the level of significance will also be 0.05.

After running 500 permutation tests to compare 'user_rating's to 'n_steps', my final p-value was approximately 0.208, so I will fail to reject my null hypothesis. This suggests that there may be an inverse relationship between 'n_steps' and 'user_rating' which could overall imply that many people prefer simpler recipes to more complex and time-consuming ones.
