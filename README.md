# Introduction
The new age of technology allows for people worldwide to connect and share their favorite recipes. What's interesting about this is the fact that something as personal as favorite recipes now becomes something anyone can share their opinion on and try for themselves. In order to make information easier to transmit, many sites have begun using a structured system to share recipes, including trackers for how many ingredients are used, how long the recipe takes, and tags to find similar recipes. Additionally, users can leave comments and ratings on any recipe available to them. This data analysis project aims to utilize the structure of these sites to determine the relationship between user-given ratings and number of steps in a recipe.

The data utilized is sourced from food.com and contains recipes from 2008 onward. Initially, two datasets were used; the first containing recipe information (cook time, ingredients, tags, recipe id, publishing date, nutritional info) and the second containing user interaction information (user id, review text, and review score out of 5). The recipe dataset has 83782 unique rows, each representing a recipe. The user interaction dataset has 731927 unique rows, each representing an interaction a user had with a recipe's review section.

After data cleaning and missingness determination, this data analysis aims to prove that the more steps a recipe has, the lower the rating will be. This hypothesis will be used because it personally relates to how I utilize recipes. As a busy college student, I seek comfort food that takes minimal effort to prepare but still satisfies.
# Data Cleaning
After initializing the necessary files and reading them in as DataFrames, the first step was to merge the files together and clean up any detrimental missing values, primarily in the 'rating' column.
